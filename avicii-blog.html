				<p> A Swedish DJ, record producer and songwriter Tim Bergling is also known by his stage
				name Avicii. Born September 8, 1989 in Stockholm. Bergling started mixing songs in his
				bedroom at the age of 8 and making music at the age of 16. He began showcasing his
				distinctive deep house style of music. When Bergling rose to fame with the single "Levels"
				during his EDM boom in the early 2010s, he made a huge impact on modern music. The
				producer and DJ was one of the first artists to cross genre boundaries and find
				mainstream success.
				<br>
				<br>
				His debut studio album True (2013), a masterful blend of elements of electronic music
				and multiple genres, charted in the top 10 in over 15 countries, as did the lead single
				'Wake Me Up' which topped the international dance charts, topped most music markets
				in Europe, and in the United States, reaching number four. Bergling received Grammy
				nominations for his "Sunshine" with David Guetta in 2012 and "Levels" in 2013.

			<p> He was the only DJ who could mix country-western style with EDM, and not only did he
				get away with it, but hit a smashing success. He was very into melodies and defined
				exactly what he wanted to do with each track. In creating the album, Bergling wanted to
				fuse electronic music genres with soul, funk, blues, folk and country, rather than focusing
				on "dirty drops".
				He was known for his work in electronic dance music, which encompasses genres such as progressive house, electro house, and EDM.
				He was merely making well-crafted pop music that showcased his heartfelt desire to honor timeless sonic styles and traditions while updating them for the modern canon of iconic, era-defining music.

    		<h3> Avicii Experience is an interactive museum in Stockholm city, honouring one of the greatest artists of our time – Tim ‘Avicii’ Bergling.</h3>

			<h2> Health </h2>
			<div class="content-3-image">	
				<div class="content-image-1"></div>
			</div> 		
			<p> In January 2012, Bergling was hospitalized for 11 days in New York City with acute
				pancreatitis from excessive alcohol consumption. During this course, Bergling was
				prescribed opioids for the pain caused by his pancreatitis, including OxyContin and
				Vicodin, to which he developed an addiction. In 2014, Bergling underwent surgery to get
				his appendix and gallbladder removed. In 2016, Bergling's declining health forced him to
				retire from performing live. Despite his rapid success, the self-described introvert
				struggled with anxiety and addiction. The chaos, pressure and spotlight took a toll on
				Bergling’s health, both mentally and physically, and he retired from touring in 2016.

		<div class="content-4">	 		
			<p> On April 20, 2018, Bergling took his own life, where he was found dead in Muscat, Oman.
				On 26 April, his family released an open letter stating: <br>
				“Our beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential
				questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who travelled and worked hard at a pace that
				led to extreme stress.
				When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be able to be happy and
				to do what he loved most – music.
				He really struggled with thoughts about Meaning, Life, Happiness.
				He could not go on any longer.
				He wanted to find peace. Tim was not made for the business machine he found himself
				in; he was a sensitive guy who loved his fans but shunned the spotlight.
				Tim, you will forever be loved and sadly missed.
				The person you were and your music will keep your memory alive.
				We love you,
				The Tim Bergling Family”

				<p> “Avicii has quite rightly been celebrated as one of the greatest DJ’s of all time and as an important artist who made massively successful records but what I will remember the most is that Tim was one of the finest songwriters I ever worked with. We could work together for 24 hours a day and his melodic ideas would never stop coming. He was a melodic beast who has not as yet had the recognition he deserves for his extraordinary talent. Tim, I love and miss you my friend!”
				<br>
				<br>	
				– Nile Rodgers, legendary disco hit-maker
				</p>
				<p> “We are extremely proud of what Tim did and his music and we also know that his person is important to many fans. We have got so many mails and letters etc. so I think that the Avicii Experience will be an important place for many fans and people who’d like to know him more.Tim the music producer and artist is one thing, his person is something else.“
